# Personal budget API 2 📃📃

A Node.js API using the Express framework with the purpose of calculating daily budget expenditure with the means of envelope budgeting. Users are able to create, read, update, delete (CRUD) as well as create transactions for individual envelopes. Envelope data is persisted in a database through PostgreSQL.

## Running the application:

To locally run the application, Node.js needs to be installed. Install the required dependencies through `npm install`.

Once the application is running locally, the documentation may be accessed at `http://localhost:5000/api/api-docs`

## Using Swagger to test:

Available Swagger tests:

### Envelopes:

* Get all envelopes: `GET /api/v1/envelopes`
* Get single envelope: `GET /api/v1/envelopes/{id}`
* Create an envelope: `POST /api/v1/envelopes`
* Update an envelope: `PUT /api/v1/envelope/{id}`
* Delete an envelope: `DELETE /api/v1/envelope/{id}`
* Create an envelope transaction: `POST /api/v1/envelope/{id}`

### Transactions:

* Retrieve all transactions: `GET /api/v1/transactions`
* Retrieve a single transaction: `GET /api/v1/transactions/{id}`
* Update a transaction: `PUT /api/v1/transactions/{id}`
* Delete an envelope: `DELETE /api/v1/transactions/{id}`

## Possible extensions for the API:

- To bolster user security, add authentication and authorization
- Establish a new API endpoint where users can add a single balance that's shared across several envelopes
